I am a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development, customer engineering, and developer experience. With expertise in Node.js, Nest.js, Typescript, and Ruby on Rails, I thrive in building robust and scalable applications.

Beyond my technical skills, I am also a community builder and event facilitator, striving to bring people together and foster collaboration. She actively organizes community events and workshops, creating spaces for learning and growth. Additionally, I am committed to empowering women from underrepresented communities by serving as a mentor.

One of my notable accomplishments is my leadership role in a non-profit organization called Hyperspace. Hyperspace aims to empower student developers in Africa by providing them with opportunities to build tangible projects through hackathons and learnables for social good. Through this initiative, we enable young talents to unleash their creativity and make a positive impact on society.

I am also an active contributor to various open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and giving back to the developer community. By contributing my expertise and knowledge, I help shape the future of open-source software.

Driven by a passion for technology and a desire to make a difference, I embody the spirit of a well-rounded engineer, community advocate, developer experience, and mentor. With my diverse skill set and dedication to empowering others, I continue to inspire and bring positive change to the world of software development.
