### Hi, I'm Iphie 👋 ✨👩🏾•💻


**A passionate Backend Engineer (Software/Customer/Developer-Experience Engineer| Community-Builder/Event-Facilitator/Open-source-Contributor) and Blockchain Enthusiast** 

I enjoy building web applications with Nodejs, Typescript and Ruby on Rails, currently deep diving into the blockchain world.

I lead a  non-profit organization Hyperspace which is centred on empowering student developers in Africa to **build actual stuffs** through hackathons and learnables.

🔭  I also organize community events and workshops and mentor women from underepresented communities and also an active contributor in open source projects.

On the side, I run a show with GitHub Education called "Tech it with Iphie", here I talk about everything technology - ranging from career paths to landing a tech

job, finding balance and leading in the industry. I also invite guests to the show to talk about their experiences and technical advices for the audience. If you

want to follow the show - See the schedule [here](https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation/schedule). it happens every Friday 7pm Wat.
